### Overview

A portfolio is composed of two or more securities. Each portfolio has risk-return characteristics of its own. This risk return review will evaluate four new investment options for inclusion in client portfolios. It report findings with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics of: 1)daily returns, 2)standard deviations, 3)sharpe ratios, and 4)betas.

### Problem Statement
Complete a quantitative analysis of four investment funds include by determining performance, volatility, risk, risk-return profile, and portfolio diversification, using the S&P500 as a benchmark. 

---

### Tools and/or Imports Used 
Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy, Pathlib, matpltlib

---

### Outcome: 
Jupyter notebook "risk_return_analysts" contains data preparations, analysis, and visualizations for key risk and return metrics. Definition of key measurements used are noted in the appendix.

### Appendix:  
List of terms definitions and code used to complete the analysis

| Term | Description | 
| :---: | :--- | 
|Daily Returns |A rate-of-return calculation that compares the current value of a stock to its initial value. In this case, the current value is the closing price, and the initial value is the closing price on the previous day. |
|Cumulative Returns |The sum of all the daily return calculations over a specified time period.The sum of all the daily return calculations over a specified time period. |
|Mean |The mean serves as a baseline for the performance of an asset over a particular time period
|Standard deviation |This measures the volatility of an asset’s price compared to its historical mean over a particular time period.|
|Sharpe ratio | The Sharpe ratio assesses risk and reward by measuring the excess return (that is, the reward, or profit) for the risk that someone assumes when investing in the asset. |
|Risk tolerance | Every investor has their own risk tolerance—the amount of risk they feel willing to take on (and still be able to sleep at night). For example, younger people tend to tolerate more investment risk, because they have a longer period of time to compensate for any investment problems. |
|Variance|Measures the risk of a single asset by considering how far the closing prices deviate from their mean value |
|Beta|Measures the directional relationship between a stock and the broader market.|
